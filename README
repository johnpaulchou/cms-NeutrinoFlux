Calculate the neutrino flux through CMS

1) Generate MinBias files with neutrino tracking by running
> cmsRun MinBias_14TeV_pythia8_cff_py_GEN_SIM.py
(alternatively, submit to crab via CrabConfigMinBias14.py)

2) Make histograms based on output files with
> cmsRun runNuFluxPlots_cfg.py
Make sure that the files are correctly specified

3) Draw histograms with plot output using the macro
> root drawplots.C


Various Notes:
python script in Analysis/test was initially generated with the following command and subsequently edited
> cmsDriver.py Configuration/Generator/python/MinBias_13TeV_pythia8_cff.py -s GEN,SIM --conditions 80X_mcRun2_asymptotic_RealisticBS_25ns_13TeV2016_v1_mc --eventcontent RAWSIM --mc --no_exec
